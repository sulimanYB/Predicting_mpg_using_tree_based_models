# Auto-MPG dataset  — tree-based regressors

* Use a regression tree to predict the mpg (miles per gallon) consumption of cars using all the six available features.
* Compare the test set RMSE of the regression tree to that achieved by a linear regression model. 
* Diagnose the bias and variance of the regression tree.
* Use Random Forests and hyperparameters' tuning to find the most important features.
* Use Gradient Bossting to find the most important features.
* Use Stochastic Gradient Bossting to find the most important features.
